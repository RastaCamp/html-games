## Game Table Visual Description (Atmospheric Version)

### OVERVIEW COMPOSITION
A mystical, layered gaming table viewed from a slight overhead angle (30-45 degrees), showing two players positioned on opposite sides. The table itself appears to exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously, with ethereal layers of reality visible like transparent sheets floating above the surface.

### THE TABLE

**Base Structure:**
- Dark obsidian-like surface with subtle galaxy swirls deep within
- Edges inlaid with glowing runes that pulse gently with power
- Six circular layer indicators embedded around the perimeter, each showing a different reality symbol
- The table seems to float slightly above the ground, with a soft glow emanating from beneath

**Size & Shape:**
- Octagonal or circular shape
- Large enough for two players with cards spread comfortably
- Center area slightly recessed, creating a natural focal point

### LAYER VISUALIZATION

The most striking feature: **Six translucent, parallel planes float above the table** like sheets of colored glass, each representing a different reality layer:

1. **Layer 1 (Physical)** - Bottom layer, semi-transparent with photo-realistic textures, earth tones
2. **Layer 2 (Emotional)** - Warm pink/orange glow, soft and pulsing like a heartbeat
3. **Layer 3 (Fractal)** - Geometric patterns repeating infinitely, cyan and purple
4. **Layer 4 (Archetypal)** - Sacred geometry, gold lines on dark background
5. **Layer 5 (Conceptual)** - Minimal, stark white symbols floating in void
6. **Layer 6 (Source)** - Pure white/gold light, almost blinding, at the top

Each layer is separated by about an inch of space, creating a stunning 3D effect. Small particles drift between layers.

### CENTRAL SHARED AREA

**The Waypoint (center of table):**
- A floating crystal or geometric shape, about 4 inches across
- Rotates slowly, reflecting the current layer's color
- Contains a face-down card visible through its facets

**Layer Shift Track (Optional Add-On):**
- Vertical track placed beside the Waypoint Zone
- Shows progression: PHYSICAL (1) → EMOTIONAL (2) → FRACTAL (3) → ARCHETTYAL (4) → CONCEPTUAL (5) → SOURCE (6)
- Each layer represented by a numbered indicator or icon
- Current layer highlighted with glow or active state
- Arrows or connecting lines show progression path
- Can be toggled on/off for different game modes

**Shared Reveal (4 slots):**
- Four glowing card-sized rectangles arranged in a diamond or line pattern
- Each slot has a soft golden border
- Cards placed here appear to float slightly above the surface
- Faint light beams connect them to the Waypoint

**Intuition Check Zone:**
- When performing an Intuition Check, three facedown cards are placed directly inside the Shared Reveal Zone
- Cards displayed as: `[ ? ] [ ? ] [ ? ]` with "Choose 1 by intuition" prompt below
- Cards appear with question mark overlays, pulsing gently
- Positioned prominently in the center of Shared Reveal area
- Visual indicator (glowing border or aura) highlights this is an active Intuition Check

**Draw Pile:**
- Neat stack of cards with ornate FUM back design
- Located to the left side of center
- Cards appear to phase slightly in and out of reality
- Tiny particles float up from the stack

**Discard Pile:**
- Slightly messy stack to the right of center
- Cards show their faces, with artwork visible
- Faint wisps of energy rise from discarded cards

### PLAYER AREAS

**Player 1 Side (Bottom of image)**

**3×3 Grid:**
- Nine card-sized rectangles arranged in perfect 3×3 grid
- Each slot outlined with player's color (deep blue)
- Slots labeled with subtle icons: S (Self), A (Action), O (Outcome) in corners
- Cards in grid appear to be slightly inset into the table surface
- Active cards have a soft glow matching current layer

**Player Stats Display:**
- Floating holographic display showing:
  - **HP/Stability**: 20 with a bar that pulses
  - **Current Layer**: Large number 1-6 with matching colored aura
  - **Energy**: 3 glowing orbs or counters
  - **Attunements**: Small gemstones that light up (0-4)

**Hand Area:**
- 7 cards fanned slightly, held just above table surface
- Cards appear to float, gently bobbing
- Backs visible to opponent, faces visible to player

**Player Avatar (optional):**
- Ethereal silhouette or partial figure behind cards
- Hands reaching toward the board
- Face obscured by shadows, but intent visible

**Player 2 Side (Top of image)**
- Mirror of Player 1's layout
- Player color: deep red
- Cards shown from back side (art visible but not readable)
- Same floating displays and grid structure

### ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS

**Lighting:**
- Primary light source seems to come from within the table itself
- Colored light beams rise from cards based on their suit:
  - ♠ Spades: Deep purple/black
  - ♥ Hearts: Warm red/pink
  - ♦ Diamonds: Bright cyan
  - ♣ Clubs: Earthy green
- Shadows are soft, with multiple directions suggesting multiple light sources

**Particle Effects:**
- Tiny glowing motes drift slowly throughout the scene
- Occasionally, a mote will be drawn into a card
- Faint sparkles when cards are "played" (static scene, but hint at motion)
- Wispy smoke-like tendrils curl at table edges

**Background:**
- Infinite void with distant stars and nebulas
- Faint outlines of impossible geometry in the distance
- Aurora-like curtains of light in the distance
- Suggestion that the table exists in its own dimension

**Mood:**
- Mysterious but inviting
- Magical but not cartoonish
- Deep, cosmic, infinite
- Slightly surreal - viewers should feel they're seeing multiple realities at once

### CARDS (Detailed Close-up)

Each card shows:
- Prominent suit symbol (♠♥♦♣) with color coding
- Large rank number/letter (2-10, J, Q, K, A)
- Stunning cosmic/surreal artwork appropriate to the card
- Border that subtly shifts color based on card's layer affinity
- Ability icons in corners
- Flavor text area (too small to read in full scene, but implied)

### COLOR PALETTE SUMMARY

| Element | Colors |
|---------|--------|
| Table base | Deep black with purple/blue galaxy swirls |
| Layer 1 | Earth tones, muted greens/browns |
| Layer 2 | Warm pinks, oranges, coral |
| Layer 3 | Cyan, electric purple, geometric patterns |
| Layer 4 | Black/white with gold accents |
| Layer 5 | Stark white, deep blue, minimal |
| Layer 6 | Pure white, gold, blinding |
| Player 1 accent | Deep electric blue |
| Player 2 accent | Deep blood red |
| Shared areas | Golden amber, soft white |
| Background | Cosmic purples, distant stars |

### CSS Implementation Guidelines

When implementing visual elements:

1. **Layer Transitions**: Use CSS transforms and opacity for layer shifts
2. **Floating Effects**: Use subtle animations with `transform: translateY()` for floating cards
3. **Glow Effects**: Use `box-shadow` with multiple layers and `filter: drop-shadow()` for ethereal glows
4. **Particle Effects**: Use CSS animations with `@keyframes` for drifting particles
5. **3D Layers**: Use `transform-style: preserve-3d` and `perspective` for layered effect
6. **Color Transitions**: Smooth transitions between layer colors using CSS `transition` or `animation`

### LAYOUT VARIANTS

**Standard Layout:**
- Full visual effects and atmospheric elements
- All shared areas visible
- Layer Shift Track optional

**Clean Tournament Version:**
- **Removed Elements:**
  - Depth Die area (if present)
  - Excessive particle effects
  - Overlapping card animations
  
- **Required Elements:**
  - Shared Reveal + Waypoint strictly centered
  - 3×3 grids only (no variations)
  - No overlapping cards
  - Clear row alignment required
  - Minimal visual effects for clarity
  - High contrast for competitive visibility

- **Layout Rules:**
  - Cards must align perfectly in grid slots
  - No visual ambiguity about card positions
  - Clean, professional aesthetic
  - Focus on gameplay clarity over atmosphere
