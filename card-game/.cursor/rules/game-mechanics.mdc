# FUM: Shatterlayers - Game Mechanics

## Turn Structure

1. **Sync Phase**: Player may shift layers (+1/-1) or stay
2. **Draw Phase**: Draw 2 cards, keep 1, place 1 in Shared Reveal
3. **Play Phase**: Place 1 card into empty grid slot
4. **Ability Phase**: Trigger abilities in order (♦ Diamonds, ♣ Clubs, ♥ Hearts, ♠ Spades, Royals, Aces)
5. **Combat Phase**: Resolve battles between opposing cards
6. **Intuition Phase** (Conditional): Triggered by specific conditions
7. **End Phase**: Discard to 7 cards, check Waypoint Attunement

## Layer-Specific Rules

### Layer 1: Physical
- Standard combat only
- No Flux triggers
- +1 Defense to all Entities

### Layer 2: Emotional
- Influence cards +50% effect
- Hearts abilities doubled
- Winners heal 1 HP

### Layer 3: Fractal
- Attacks may split to adjacent slots
- Flux triggers twice
- Echo keyword active
- Diamond abilities reveal 2 cards instead of 1

### Layer 4: Archetypal
- Entities reveal True Forms (+2 Presence)
- Queen abilities affect whole row
- Enemy debuffs amplified

### Layer 5: Conceptual
- Can treat 1 card as another type
- May ignore 1 layer restriction
- King abilities affect entire grid
- Can redirect attacks

### Layer 6: Source
- Double all damage/effects
- Can play cards from discard
- Can create 1 custom rule for turn
- **Source Fade**: After leaving, -1 to all stats for 2 turns

## Win Conditions

1. **Stability Break**: Reduce opponent HP to 0
2. **Attunement Victory**: Reach 4 Attunements first
3. **Layer Collapse**: Opponent over-shifts beyond Layer 6 or takes 3+ Flux damage
4. **Source Resonance** (Secret): Visit each layer (1-6) in order, play 1 Entity in each layer

## Waypoint Attunement

**How to Attune**:
- Play a card matching Waypoint suit
- Successfully guess Intuition Check
- Activate certain Ace abilities
- Complete a full row in grid

**Attunement Bonuses**:
- 1 Attunement = Draw 1 card
- 2 Attunements = +1 Energy per turn
- 3 Attunements = Reduce opponent max hand size
- 4 Attunements = **WIN CONDITION**

## Energy System

- Start with 3 Energy
- Gain +1 Energy per turn
- Max 10 Energy

**Energy Costs**:
- Reroll a card: 1
- Force Intuition Check: 2
- Activate Ace ability: 3
- Layer Shift (extra): 1
- Draw extra card: 2

## Combat Resolution

**When Cards Battle**:
- Compare Modified Strength = Rank + Bonuses – Debuffs
- Higher strength destroys lower
- Ties destroy both cards
- Destroyed cards go to owner's discard pile

**Damage to Player**:
- Unblocked attackers deal damage = their Strength
- Damage reduces player HP (Stability)
- HP at 0 = loss

## Intuition Check Process

1. Opponent selects 3 facedown cards from hand/deck
2. Player guesses: "Which has highest value?" OR "Which suit?"
3. Reveal cards
4. If correct: Bonus effect + Intuition Counter
5. If incorrect: Normal resolution, possible minor penalty

**Intuition Bonuses** (scales with counters):
- 1 Counter: Draw 1 card
- 2 Counters: +1 Energy
- 3+ Counters: +1 Attunement

## Card Effect Resolution Order

1. **Diamonds** (Vision - reveals/scries first)
2. **Clubs** (Matter - barriers/defense)
3. **Hearts** (Life - healing/support)
4. **Spades** (Void - attack/disruption)
5. **Royals** (J/Q/K - special abilities)
6. **Aces** (Anchors - major effects)

## Grid Slot Meanings

- **S (Self)**: Core identity, defensive position
- **A (Action)**: Offensive move, ability trigger
- **O (Outcome)**: Result modifier, combo enabler

Each row represents a complete "engagement":
- Row 1: Primary engagement
- Row 2: Secondary/Support
- Row 3: Reserve/Setup
