# FUM: Shatterlayers - Tutorial Design Document

## Core Philosophy

**"Show, Don't Tell. Play, Don't Read."**

The tutorial should feel like playing, not like studying. Players should finish thinking "That was fun!" not "Thank god that's over."

## Tutorial Structure Overview

## CHAPTER 1: YOUR FIRST CARDS

**Screen State:**
- Empty 3×3 grid for player
- Pre-set 3 cards in opponent's grid (so player sees what to do)
- Hand of 3 simple cards for player
- Slots labeled: S (Self), A (Action), O (Outcome)

**Narrator (Luna):** "Welcome to FUM. See those empty slots? That's where your power lives. Your opponent already placed cards. Your turn."

### Beat-by-Beat Breakdown

| Beat | Action | Visual Feedback | Voice/Text |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Card glows | Pulsing green outline | "This card wants to be played." |
| 2 | Drag to empty slot | Smooth motion, satisfying thud | "Drop it in any empty SELF slot." |
| 3 | Card locks in | Gentle glow, border appears | "Perfect. That's your first card." |
| 4 | Second card glows | Different card pulses | "Now place your second card." |
| 5 | Place in ACTION slot | Slot highlights when hover | "ACTION slots are for attacking." |
| 6 | Third card | Final slot pulses | "One more for OUTCOME." |

**Reward Moment:**
- "Look at that. You built your first grid. Feels good, right?"
- Confetti pop when grid is full
- Simple satisfaction

## CHAPTER 2: YOUR FIRST BATTLE

**Current State:**
- Player's grid: 3 cards placed
- Opponent's grid: 3 cards showing
- Cards aligned for combat

**Narrator:** "Here's the magic part. Watch what happens when your cards meet theirs."

### Visual Teaching Flow

```
YOUR CARD: 5♥  (Strength 5)
     ↓
OPPONENT: 3♠  (Strength 3)
     ↓
💥 5 beats 3!
     ↓
OPPONENT CARD DESTROYED
     ↓
EXTRA DAMAGE: 2 goes to opponent HP
```

### Beat-by-Beat Breakdown

| Beat | Action | Visual | Text |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | Click "FIGHT" button | Cards pulse | "Click FIGHT to start the battle." |
| 2 | Cards compare | Strength numbers pop | "Your 5 is stronger than their 3." |
| 3 | Loser destroys | Shatter animation | "Their card is gone." |
| 4 | Damage transfers | HP bar decreases | "Extra damage hits them directly!" |
| 5 | Repeat for all rows | Chain animations | "That's all 3 fights." |

**Reward Moment:**
- Opponent HP drops visibly
- "You just hurt them. And it felt awesome."

## CHAPTER 3: MEET THE LAYERS

**Visual:** Three giant glowing buttons appear:
```
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│   LAYER 1   │ │   LAYER 2   │ │   LAYER 3   │
│   PHYSICAL  │ │  EMOTIONAL  │ │   FRACTAL   │
│  Earth tone │ │  Pink glow  │ │ Cyan pattern│
└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

**Narrator:** "Here's where FUM gets wild. You can shift reality. Try clicking Layer 2."

### Layer Shift Demonstration

| Step | Action | Visual Change | Text |
|------|--------|---------------|------|
| 1 | Click Layer 2 | WHOLE BOARD shifts pink | "Welcome to the Emotional layer." |
| 2 | Hearts card glows | ♥ cards pulse brighter | "See how your Hearts card glows?" |
| 3 | Hover over card | Tooltip appears | "In Emotional layer, Hearts heal double." |
| 4 | Click Layer 3 | Board shifts cyan/geometric | "Now try Fractal layer." |
| 5 | Show attack split | Visual arrows | "Here, attacks can split to neighbors." |
| 6 | Click back to Layer 1 | Returns to normal | "You can shift anytime. It's YOUR reality." |

**Fun Element:** Screen literally "shifts" with a satisfying warp effect, like changing dimensions in a sci-fi show.

## CHAPTER 4: TRUST YOUR GUT

**Setup:** Screen dims slightly. Three facedown cards appear.

**Narrator (whispering tone):** "Sometimes, you have to FEEL the right choice. No logic. Just gut."

### Intuition Tutorial Display

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Beat-by-Beat Breakdown

| Beat | Action | Feedback | Text |
|------|--------|----------|------|
| 1 | Hover over cards | Soft pulse | "Don't overthink. Which one feels right?" |
| 2 | Click card 2 | Dramatic pause | "Let's see..." |
| 3 | Reveal animation | Cards flip dramatically | "It WAS the highest! You guessed it!" |
| 4 | Bonus triggers | Golden explosion | "Intuition success! Double power this turn!" |

**If player guesses wrong:**
- "Not this time. But trust us - that feeling gets stronger with practice."

**Fun Element:** Screen literally vibrates slightly during guess. Heartbeat sound. When correct, triumphant music swell.

## CHAPTER 5: WIN YOUR FIRST GAME

**Setup:**
- Opponent at 5 HP (almost dead)
- Player has full grid, good cards
- All mechanics now active

**Narrator:** "They're almost done. Finish them. You know what to do."

### Minimal Guidance

- No hand-holding
- Subtle glow on best attacking card
- Player must remember:
  - Play cards
  - Shift layers if wanted
  - Fight
  - Use intuition if appears

**When player wins:**
```
🎉🎉🎉 VICTORY! 🎉🎉🎉

You just won your first FUM battle!

UNLOCKED: Practice Mode
UNLOCKED: Layer 2 Cards
UNLOCKED: New Opponent

[QUICK MATCH] [CAMPAIGN] [DECK BUILDER]

**Narrator:** "That's it. You're a Layer Walker now. The realms are yours to explore."

## UI/UX DESIGN FOR TUTORIAL

### Visual Cues System

| Cue | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| GREEN GLOW | Do this now |
| PULSING | This is important |
| ARROW | Drag here |
| MAGNIFY | Hover for info |
| CONFETTI | You did it right! |

### Hotspot Highlighting

When player needs to click somewhere, that area glows with a bright, pulsing ring. Rest of screen slightly dims.

### Progress Indicator

```
[⚫⚫⚫⚫⚪] Chapter 4 of 5
```

Shows at bottom, so player knows they're almost done.

## DIFFICULTY SCALING

### If Player Struggles

- **After 2 failed attempts:** Gentle hint appears: "Try putting your strongest card in the ACTION slot."
- **After 3 failures:** Optional "Show Me" button appears that demonstrates the move.

### If Player Breezes Through

- Skip some explanations. Let them discover.
- "You're fast! We'll let you figure this one out."

## FUN ELEMENTS TO ADD

### Easter Eggs

- If player clicks same spot 5 times: "Reality bends to your will. Eventually."
- Hidden achievement: "Button Masher" for clicking randomly during tutorial

### Humor

- When player makes first mistake: "Even Layer Walkers stumble. Try again?"
- When player wins first battle: "The layers trembled. You did that."

### Sound Design

- Each correct action = satisfying "ding"
- Each chapter complete = ascending chime
- Victory = crowd cheer (imaginary crowd in their head)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Narrator System

- Voice tone: Encouraging, never condescending
- Text boxes: Short, punchy, action-oriented
- Timing: 2-3 seconds per message, auto-advance or click-to-continue

### Visual Effects Priority

1. **Green pulse** - Highest priority, always visible
2. **Confetti** - Celebratory, not overwhelming
3. **Layer shift** - Dramatic but smooth (0.5s transition)
4. **Card animations** - Satisfying snap/thud sounds
5. **HP changes** - Clear, visible, with floating numbers

### Accessibility

- All text should have voice narration option
- Visual cues should work for colorblind players (use patterns + colors)
- Skip tutorial option available after first completion
- Pause tutorial option at any time
